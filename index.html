                Quiet observation is
                a quiet dance with the world,
                where thoughts swirl,
                and feelings are hidden behind stillness,
                where silence speaks louder than words,
                a landscape of unspoken truths,
                where I sit, watching, listening,
                reflecting without interruption,
                gathering pieces to understand more,
                yet unsure how to piece them together,
                a reservoir of thoughts unspoken,
                tucked away in the spaces between interactions,
                noticing the details others may miss,
                the tension between wanting to be heard
                and the uncertainty of how to say it,
                wrapped in the comfort of art,
                where expression feels more direct,
                a language that feels like home,
                though my voice still trembles at times,
                learning to trust the power of my words,
                slowly,
                step by step,
                finding courage to speak the thoughts I hold,
                weaving the quiet with the vocal,
                one word at a time,
                exploring the boundaries between silence and sound,
                trying to be heard in a way that feels real,
                and wondering if the words will be enough,
                a reflection,
                a voice emerging from the silence.
